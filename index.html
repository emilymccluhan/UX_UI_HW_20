        Non-Profit Redesign for 501(c3)nonprofit Gamers Outreach
      </p>
      <hr class="my-4" />
      <p>
        The UC Berkeley UX/UI Bootcamp tasked my team of 5 with conducting a
        pro-bono redesign for a non-profit of our choice. We worked quickly
        within a 4 week time constraint, choosing to focus on making it easier
        for users to conduct fundraisers for Gamers Outreach.

        <h5 class="mt-0">Research and Definition</h5>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>We needed to enhance the Gamers Outreach website in order to encourage more charity streams and foster positive reviews from, and thus build the trust of, the gaming community.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We re-designed the Gamers Outreach website to provide individuals with more accurate and meaningful information about fundraising efforts, and make it easier to support the nonprofit. This would help establish trust and confidence in the non-profit, increase awareness about fundraising efforts, and ultimately empower more individuals with the tools to get involved.</p>

          <div class="media-body">
            <h5 class="mt-0">Ideation & Prototyping</h5>
            After anaylzing our findings from initial research we began drafting wireframes that later turned into our initial low fidelity prototype for this project.

      <div class="media-body">
        <h5 class="mt-0">Testing</h5>
        Inevitably, issues arose during our second round of usability testing,
        in which myself and another teammate conducted in-person usability tests
        of our mid-fidelity prototype. Many users could access the fundraising
        page, but not many though to click on the "about Twitch streaming" page
        that we developed. Through additional testing we were able to narrow
        down the issue to our button text. The initial label "About Twitch" was
        too vague, and users already familiar with Twitch's platform did not
        feel the need to click on the page, though they still felt they lacked
        clarity about setting up a fundraising stream with Twitch after
        scrolling through the fundraising page. Our solution was to put more
        active language in the button text, and changed the label to "Stream
        with Twitch"

            <h5 class="mt-0">Final</h5>
            I would love to go back and build out solutions to other design
            flaws that were uncovered during our initial user interviews. We
            found there was difficulty for healthcare workers looking to request
            Gamer's Outreach services, but unfortunately we were unable to
            address this in our redesign given the time constraints.
